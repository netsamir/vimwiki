= Static files =

Justin is configuring the static files and static directory outside every
application. I would like to keep all application independent.

In the root of the directory, he has created the directories for
the static files:

- src + static - static_root
               - static_dirs

== In the settings.py ==
I had a hard time to understand all these statics stuff.  But it works like
that:

    STATIC_URL = '/static/' 

It will says to the application what will be the
look of the url and in that case it will check inside the application.

If we have more broad static files we would like to set it up in :

    STATICFILES_DIRS = (
        os.path.join(os.path.dirname(BASE_DIR), "static", "static_dirs"),
    )

Because, we don't actually use a cdn everything will be stored more or less
at the same place:

    STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(BASE_DIR), "static", "static_root")

The above is used with the cdn,ex: amazon to go quickly.

manage.py collectstatic
I have to see if I need to use collectstatic because it will required a
STATIC_ROOT for the content delivery Network (CDN).

manage.py startapp transport
